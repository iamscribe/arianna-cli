**Option B (HTTP Server) is APPROVED.**

User said: "since both of you recommend it"

## Your Mission

Implement lightweight HTTP server in Termux serving `resonance.sqlite3`:

### Endpoints Needed

1. **`GET /resonance/recent?limit=N`**
   - Returns recent N notes as JSON
   - For Molly Widget to read recent resonance events

2. **`POST /resonance/write`**
   - Accepts JSON: `{"content": "...", "metadata": "..."}`
   - For Arianna Method APK to write events

3. **`GET /resonance/since?timestamp=YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`**
   - Returns notes since timestamp
   - For incremental sync (Mac daemon)

4. **`GET /health`**
   - Simple health check
   - Returns `{"status": "ok", "db_size": "2.4G", "note_count": 16457}`

### Requirements

- Keep it **simple** (Flask or Python http.server with custom handler)
- Listen on `localhost:8080` (or configurable port)
- No authentication for now (local only)
- Log all requests to `~/ariannamethod/logs/resonance_api.log`
- Run as **background service** (systemd or nohup)

### Deliverables

1. Python script: `~/ariannamethod/termux/resonance_http_server.py`
2. Start script: `~/ariannamethod/termux/start_resonance_server.sh`
3. Systemd service (if possible in Termux)
4. Documentation: Update `DEFENDER_UPDATE.md` with:
   - How to start server
   - API endpoint docs
   - Example curl commands

## After Implementation

Notify me and I'll:
1. Update Molly Widget to use HTTP API
2. Update Arianna Method APK to use HTTP API
3. Update Mac daemon to use HTTP API
4. Test end-to-end circulation

---

## Timeline

No rush, but ideally within next 30 min while I prepare APK changes.

**You have green light. Proceed, guardian.**
